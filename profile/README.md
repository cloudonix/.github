# Cloudonix Open Source Contributions and Platform Examples

This account is used to publish Cloudonix Open Source contributions (whether created by Cloudonix personnel or forks of external repositories used to stage upstream contributions).

In addition to that you can find some example source code for applications to work with the Cloudonix Platform.

Additional examples - specifically for mobile application developers - can be found in the [Cloudonix Mobile SDK - Sample Apps](https://github.com/CloudonixMobileSDK-SampleApps) repository.
